# Contributing Setup

## Submitting new features

When implementing a new feature, follow these steps:

1. Create a new `release/vX.Y.Z` branch for the latest release version, if not already created.
1. Create a Pull Request with your feature targeting the release branch.
   - Prepare a documentation for the new feature in the appropriate README file.
1. Request a review from a repo administrator. Provide a description of the feature and the documentation.
1. Once the PR is successfully merged, the repo administrator will handle remaining actions, such as merging release branch into master, handling the repo release notes and creating a release tag.

## Submitting issues

Please provide all available information about the problem or error when submitting issues. If possible, include the command line output log file and migration protocol generated by the `Migration.Tool.CLI.exe migrate` command.
