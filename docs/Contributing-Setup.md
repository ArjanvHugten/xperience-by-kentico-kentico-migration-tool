# Contributing Setup

## Submitting new features

When implementing a new feature, follow these steps:

1. Create a new `release/vX.Y.Z` branch for the latest release version, if not already created.
1. Create a Pull Request with your feature targeting the release branch.
   - Prepare a documentation for the new feature in the appropriate README file.
1. Request a review from a repo administrator. Provide a description of the feature and the documentation.

The repo administrator will handle remaining actions:

1. Review any PRs targeting the release branch.
1. Add the release to the *Library Version Matrix* in the [main README file](/README.md).
1. Merge the release branch into the `master` branch at the appropriate time.
1. Create a new GitHub [Tag](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-kentico-migration-tool/tags) for the released version of the repo.
1. Create GitHub [release notes](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-kentico-migration-tool/releases) for the released version of the repo.
1. Delete the release branch (and optionally create a branch for the next release).

## Submitting issues

Please provide all available information about the problem or error when submitting issues. If possible, include the command line output log file and migration protocol generated by the `Migration.Tool.CLI.exe migrate` command.
